# QuizApp-Microservices

This is a simple practice project of Springboot Microservices

I have created this project with Springboot3 and Java 17. This is a complete backend REST API project.
Implemented SpringBoot concepts, Spring Data JPA, Service Registry (Eureka), Service Client (Feign), API Gateway, SQL Database (Postgres)

This project has 2 services
1. Question Service - helps to do CRUD operations on questions
2. Quiz Service - helps to create Quiz, get response from user and calculate the result
